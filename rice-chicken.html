        <ul>
            <li><strong>1 lb (450 g) chicken thighs</strong> (bone-in, skin-on for more flavor, or boneless, skinless for a leaner option)</li>
            <li><strong>1 tablespoon olive oil</strong></li>
            <li><strong>1 onion</strong>, finely chopped</li>
            <li><strong>2 cloves garlic</strong>, minced</li>
            <li><strong>3 cups chicken broth </strong> (you can adjust the amount depending on the rice type)</li>
            <li><strong> teaspoon salt</strong> (adjust to taste)</li>
            <li><strong>1/2 teaspoon black pepper</strong></li>
            <li><strong>1 teaspoon dried thyme</strong> (or any herbs of your choice like rosemary or oregano)</li>
            <li><strong>1 cup frozen peas</strong> (optional)</li>

        </ul>

    <p><h2>Cooking Steps:</h2></p>
                
    <ol>
        <li><h3><strong>Prepare the Ingredients:</strong></h3></li>
    <ul>
        <li>Rinse the rice under cold water until the water runs clear.</p>
        <p>This removes excess starch and helps prevent the rice from being too sticky.</p></li>
        <li>Dice the onion and bell pepper, and mince the garlic.</li>
        <li>Cut the chicken into bite-sized pieces and season with salt and pepper.</li>    
    </ul>
    
        <li><h2>Brown the Chicken:</h2></li>
    <ul>
        <li>Heat the olive oil in a large skillet or saucepan over medium-high heat.</li>
        <li>Add the chicken pieces to the pan and cook until they are golden brown on all sides, about 5-7 minutes. 
        <p>Remove the chicken from the pan and set aside.</p></li>
    </ul>
            
        <li><h2>Saut√© the Vegetables:</h2></li>
     <ul>

        <li>In the same pan, add a little more oil if needed, then add the onion and bell pepper.</li>
        <li>Cook for about 3-5 minutes until the vegetables are soft.</li>
        <li>Add the minced garlic and cook for another minute until fragrant.</li>
    </ul>    
        <li><h2>Cook the Rice:</h2></li>

    <ul>
        <li>Add the rice to the pan with the vegetables and stir to combine.</li>
        <li>Cook for about 2 minutes, stirring frequently, to lightly toast the rice.</li>
        <li>Add the chicken broth and bring the mixture to a boil.</li>
        <li>Return the browned chicken to the pan. 
        <p>Add any additional herbs or spices (like a bay leaf or dried thyme).</p></li>
    </ul>
  
        <li><h2>Simmer:</h2></li>

    <ul>
        <li>Reduce the heat to low and cover the pan. 
        <p>Let the mixture simmer for about 18-20 minutes, or until the rice is tender and the liquid is absorbed.</p></li>
    </ul>

        <li><h2>Finish and Serve:</h2></li>

    <ul>
        <li>Remove the pan from the heat and let it sit, covered, for 5 minutes. 
        <p>This allows the rice to finish absorbing any residual liquid without overcooking.</p></li>
        <li>Fluff the rice with a fork, then taste and adjust the seasoning if necessary.</li> 
        <li>Serve hot, garnished with fresh herbs like parsley or cilantro if desired.</li>   
    </ul>

    </ol>
