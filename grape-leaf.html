        <p><h3>Decription:</h3></p>
        <p><h4>Making stuffed grape leaves, also known as "Dolmas" or "Dolmades" in Mediterranean and Middle Eastern cuisines, can be a bit time-consuming,</h4></p>
            <p><h4>but I can guide you through a quicker version of the traditional recipe. Here’s a simplified step-by-step process:</h4></p>
            <p><h3><strong>Ingredients:</strong></h3></p>
       <!--unordered lists:shows up as bullet points and order does not matter-->
        <ul>
            <li>Grape leaves (canned or fresh if available; if using fresh, they need to be blanched first)</li>
            <li>1 cup of cooked rice (or use quick-cooking rice for faster preparation)</li>
            <li>1 onion, finely chopped</li>
            <li>2-3 cloves of garlic, minced</li>
            <li>Fresh herbs (like parsley and dill), chopped</li>
            <li>1/4 cup olive oil</li>
            <li>1/2 lemon, juiced</li>
            <li>Salt and pepper to taste</li>
            <li>Optional: ground meat (beef, lamb, or another), pine nuts, or currants</li>
        </ul>
    <p><h2>Cooking Steps:</h2></p>
    <!--ordered list:the order does matter and the list is numbered-->
    <ol>    
        <li><h3><strong>Prepare the Filling:</strong></h3></li>
    
    <ul>
        <li><p>In a large bowl, mix the cooked rice, chopped onion, minced garlic, chopped herbs, lemon juice, olive oil, and season with salt and pepper.</li></p>
        <p>If you’re adding ground meat, mix it in raw—it will cook when you cook the grape leaves.</p>
        <p> </p>
        <li><p>For an even quicker version, you can use pre-cooked or leftover rice, and if using meat, pre-cooked and seasoned ground meat can also save time</li></p>
    </ul>
    
        <li><h3><strong>Prepare the Grape Leaves:</strong></h3></li>
    
    <ul>
        <li><p>If using canned grape leaves, rinse them under cold water and pat them dry with paper towels. If they are too briny, you might need to soak them in water for 10-15 minutes before using.</li></p>
        <p> </p>
        <li><p>If you're using fresh grape leaves, blanch them in boiling water for a few seconds until they become soft, then plunge into ice water, and drain.</li></p>
    </ul>

        <li><p><h3><strong>Assemble the Dolmas:</li></p></h3></strong>
    
    <ul>
        <li><p>Lay a grape leaf flat on a work surface with the shiny side down and the stem end facing you.</p></li>
        <li><p>Place about a tablespoon of the filling near the stem end of the leaf.</p></li>
        <li><p>Fold the stem end over the filling, then fold in the sides and roll the leaf up tightly into a neat parcel.</p></li>
    </ul>
    <li><p><h3>Cook the Grape Leaves:</h3></p></li>
    <ul>
        <li><p>Place the rolled grape leaves seam side down in a large skillet</p></li>
        <li><p>Pour over a mix of water and lemon juice (enough to just cover the grape leaves), add a drizzle of olive oil, and place a plate on top of the grape leaves to keep them submerged.</p></li>
        <li><p>Bring to a simmer, cover, and cook for about 30-40 minutes if including raw meat in the filling, or about 20 minutes if it's just rice and herbs.</p></li>
    </ul>

        <li><h3>Serve:</h3></li></p>
    
    <ul>
        <li>Once cooked, let them cool slightly and serve warm or at room temperature with additional lemon wedges or a side of yogurt.</li>
    </ul>
    </ol>
